# /nerdy|weird|words/

A place where writers share their work with beta readers, gather feedback, and engage with them.

Still in development. Open source. Here you can find the code and roadmap.

The name, the slogan, and their stylization are inspired by regular expressions, a tool software developers use to match patterns in text. I was playing with a pattern that could match both *weird* and *words*, and, being the nerd I am, I threw that into the mix too.

The logo represents two brain halves—the right one flipped upside down—both resembling clouds, because this space thrives on imagination and lives in the cloud.

I created this because I’m about to finish my first novella, and I want to share it with beta readers in a meaningful, interactive way. And no existing platform felt quite right.
